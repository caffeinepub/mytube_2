# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the transparent/glass effect from the Profile and Notifications dropdown panels so the area behind them is not see-through.

**Planned changes:**
- Update Profile (user) dropdown styling so the dropdown panel uses a fully opaque background in both light and dark mode.
- Update Notifications dropdown styling so the dropdown panel (including header area) uses the same fully opaque background treatment for consistency.
- Ensure dropdown content (text/icons), spacing, alignment, width, and scroll behavior remain unchanged while removing transparency/backdrop blur effects.

**User-visible outcome:** When opening the Profile or Notifications dropdown from the top-right, the menus appear as solid (non-transparent) panels in both light and dark themes, with the same layout and readability as before.
