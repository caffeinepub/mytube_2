  "summary": "Implemented a theme toggle UI within the profile dropdown and wrapped the app with next-themes ThemeProvider configured for class-based dark mode. Also added a third \"System\" theme option and set defaultTheme to \"system\" in App.tsx.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-37",
      "requirement": "Ensure the default theme behavior is well-defined and does not break existing styling: keep current default theme behavior unless explicitly changed as part of implementing the toggle, and ensure both Light and Dark themes have readable contrast for core surfaces (background, card, border, text).",
      "reason": "The diff changes ThemeProvider configuration to `defaultTheme=\"system\"`, which may alter the prior default theme behavior; there is no accompanying change/evidence showing that this preserves the existing default appearance or validates light/dark contrast via CSS token adjustments.",

      "description": "Added a third theme option \"System\" in the theme toggle menu.",
      "reason": "The request only specifies a Light Mode / Dark Mode toggle and explicitly says not to add other settings beyond the theme toggle; adding a System option is an additional setting not requested.",
